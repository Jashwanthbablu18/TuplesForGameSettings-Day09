# 🎮 Day 9 - Game Settings Config Using Tuples

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to **Day 9** of my **#30DaysOfPythonChallenge**. Today’s project explores Python **tuples** by simulating game configuration settings.

---

## 📌 What’s This About?
Today’s focus: **Tuples in Python** — ordered, immutable collections that are great for fixed settings and grouped data.

---

## 💭 Why Tuples?
Unlike lists, tuples can’t be changed after creation, which makes them perfect for:
- Storing constant configuration data
- Protecting values from accidental modification
- Optimizing memory in some cases

---

## ✨ Features

Here’s what the app demonstrates:
- 🖥️ Stores screen resolution as a tuple (e.g., `(1920, 1080)`)
- 🎮 Defines key bindings using a tuple (e.g., `("W", "A", "S", "D")`)
- 📜 Lists available game modes using a tuple
- 🚫 Shows what happens when you try to modify a tuple — `TypeError`

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stuff

Built with:
- 🐍 **Python 3**
- 📦 Tuples
- 🔍 Indexing and accessing elements
- 🛑 Error handling (immutability showcase)

---

## 🚀 Getting It Running

### ✅ What You’ll Need
Just Python 3!  
Run the code using:
```bash
python Day-09Code.py
